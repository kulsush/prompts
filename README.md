Prompt : Can yt studio be connected to Looker ?
Reply : { 

YouTube Studio (YT Studio) does not have a built-in connector for Looker (Google Cloud's BI tool). However, you can integrate them using BigQuery as a bridge. Here's how:
Steps to Connect YT Studio to Looker
1. Export YouTube Analytics Data to BigQuery
If you're using YouTube Content Manager, you can enable YouTube Reporting API to export analytics data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and then load it into BigQuery.
Alternatively, use Google Apps Script or Python scripts (via YouTube Data API) to fetch reports and push them to BigQuery.
2. Connect BigQuery to Looker
In Looker, add BigQuery as a data source.
Create LookML models to structure your YouTube data for reporting.
Build dashboards with subscriber growth, watch time, revenue, etc.
Alternative Approach (Without BigQuery)
Export YouTube Analytics CSV reports and upload them to Google Sheets.
Use Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to visualize the data.
If necessary, Looker can access Google Sheets via external data sources.
Would you like help with setting up the API, writing a script, or designing Looker dashboards? ðŸš€ }
